## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
# Karla's code
```

## HT

```{r}
# this is new code
```

```{r}
# Mauricio`s code`
```

```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD
#Rachael is here
=======
# Anna's code
>>>>>>> b0180ae614c91ced40afd5350cfdc37cb8f2487a
```
